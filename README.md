Tenchu Remake Version 2:
An independent, unofficial remake of the classic Tenchu series, rebuilt from scratch using Unreal Engine 5.5. Due to significant engine updates, this new version replaces my previous attempt.

Commit History:
For transparency, the commit history of my initial project (UE 5.2) can be found in our previous repository: UnrealEngine-Tenchu-Remake

Previous Project Background:
My original project, started in UE 5.2, faced insurmountable compatibility issues during the engine update to 5.5. Rather than struggling with legacy code, I chose to rebuild and take advantage of the latest UE5 features.
